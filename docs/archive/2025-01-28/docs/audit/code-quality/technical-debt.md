# Code Quality Audit: Technical Debt Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-27  
**Auditor**: Claude Code Assistant  
**Codebase**: Driplo.bg Marketplace

## Executive Summary

The Driplo.bg codebase has accumulated significant technical debt estimated at **380-420 hours** of refactoring work. The debt primarily stems from rapid development without consistent patterns, component duplication, and incomplete migrations to newer technologies.

## Conclusion

The technical debt in Driplo.bg is significant but manageable. The highest priority should be fixing critical issues that block development, followed by systematic reduction of complexity and duplication.

**Technical Debt Score: 6.5/10** (where 10 is unmanageable)

The debt is at a critical juncture - action now will prevent exponential growth and maintain the codebase's viability. Delaying will result in significantly higher costs and potential project failure.
