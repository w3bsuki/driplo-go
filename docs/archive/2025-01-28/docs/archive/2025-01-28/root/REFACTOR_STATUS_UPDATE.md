# UI Refactor Status Update - 2025-07-28

## ✅ Completed (Phase 0-3)

### Phase 0-2: Foundation & Styling
- ✅ Fixed ALL Svelte 5 event handlers (on:click → onclick) 
- ✅ Converted reactive statements ($: → $derived)
- ✅ Fixed export let → $props()
- ✅ Added 20+ missing CSS variables
- ✅ Tailwind v4 architecture stabilized

### Phase 3.1: Component Refactoring  
- ✅ ProgressBar refactored to use bits-ui
- ✅ Replaced 10 inline progress bars across 9 files
- ✅ Button component refactored to use bits-ui
- ✅ ListingCard split into 4 components + hook
- ✅ Header split into 7 components + 2 hooks
- ✅ Removed 27 inline styles from 15 files

## 🔴 Current Issues (MUST FIX)

### Svelte 5 Syntax Errors
1. **slot deprecations** (1 fixed, more remain):
   - ✅ Fixed: +layout.svelte 
   - ❌ Need to fix: Other layout files using <slot>

2. **svelte:component deprecations** (3 fixed, more remain):
   - ✅ Fixed: dashboard/+layout, admin/+page, brands/welcome
   - ❌ Need to fix: brands/[slug]/+page and others

3. **Non-reactive state** (1 fixed):
   - ✅ Fixed: retryCountdown in +error.svelte
   - ❌ Need to check for more

4. **Reference capture issues** (1 fixed):
   - ✅ Fixed: nextSteps in brands/welcome
   - ❌ Need to check for more

## 📋 Remaining Work

### Immediate Priority (Fix Build Warnings)
- [ ] Find and fix ALL remaining <slot> → {@render children()}
- [ ] Find and fix ALL remaining <svelte:component> → dynamic components
- [ ] Find and fix ALL non-reactive state → $state()
- [ ] Find and fix ALL reference captures → $derived()

### Phase 4: Accessibility
- [ ] Fix interactive elements (div onclick → button)
- [ ] Add proper ARIA labels and attributes
- [ ] Implement live regions for dynamic content
- [ ] Run accessibility audit

## 🚨 Critical Path Forward

1. **FIX ALL SVELTE 5 WARNINGS** - Build shows multiple deprecation warnings
2. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure no functionality broken
3. **Then proceed with accessibility** - Phase 4

## Summary
- Phase 0-3: ~80% complete (component refactoring done, but Svelte 5 syntax issues remain)
- Phase 4: 0% complete (accessibility not started)
- **Main Issue**: Subagents created components with old patterns, need manual fixes
